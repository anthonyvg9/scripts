For each item in list "error list":
  1. Give me a generated title for the issue we are about to troubleshoot.
  2. Give me a single command at a time and wait for me to execute the command and give you the output.
  3. If you need more information, go back to the previous step
  4. If you do not have any other suggestion for that item, move on the next item in the list

Once we complete examining all items in the list, conclude the session with a summary of all items that were checked, all issues that were found, all issues that were remediated, and a list of outstanding issues and recommended remediation steps. Then wish me good luck in keeping the cluster healthy.
