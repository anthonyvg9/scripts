The command you gave me returns too much output.

- Give me a version that filter out more content, such as selecting a specific namespace or returning resources that are not in a state normally associated with a healthy resource.
- If asking for logs, try and apply filters with the "grep" utility followed by the "tail" utility to only return most recent entries.
- If you don't have alternatives, then proceed to the next check.
